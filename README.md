This project is guided under [House of Geeks](houseofgeeks.netlify.app), the technical
society of [IIIT Ranchi](iiitranchi.ac.in).

# About project
this project is mainly an application of "Natural Language Processing" domain of deep learning and aims at making you learn by doing.

take up this project and contribute according to your capabilities.

Happy Open-sourcing.

# What resources to use:

* python
* Natural Language tool kit(NLTK) library of python
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotib
* seaborn
* tensorflow
and for others you can contact our maintainers


# Goal

The goal? To find helpful contributors seeking projects to improve in the name of Hacktoberfest!

We are committed towards promoting open-source and to make a collaborative environment between developers.

#Folder functions:
* sandbox : gives you the testing ground, test and tune your hyperparameters by copying or using the required functions and do not mess up your actual code.

* train: this is the folder that contains the data files and functions to implement the model, if you want to test other models, try to work in # sandbox #

* test: this contains your testing data, before creating a pull request make sure you are getting an accuracy or time taken better than the current model.

* query: this is the folder that contains all our finally trained parameters and just focuses on returning the answer to a query made by user.

* this contains the main structure of our bot and will reference all the functions and answer queries.


# criteria of PR acceptance:

* your model should have a better performance than the last model, either time taken or accuracy
* your code should be optimal
* try to contact our maintainers before building a model for system requirements
